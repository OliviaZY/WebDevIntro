		<h2>This is the letter for her</h2>

		<p>Before I met you, I didn’t think love was for me. It was something other people had and felt. Something in movies and in TV shows. It felt more like a wish I had then something real. Now that I’m with you, love is so much more tangible. It’s something I can reach out and touch. It’s so much more than a wish or a hope (though it does give me hope, for so many things), it’s the very real, wonderful person I wake up to. The warm hand next to mine, the brush of hair against my cheek. I love you and because of that love I love so much more than you. I love myself and the world in a way I never thought possible. You’ve made that possible for me. You’ve made everything possible.</p>

		<p>Sometimes when I look at the ocean or an especially large mountain range, I feel overwhelmed and small, but in a good way. It’s comforting to know there’s something out there bigger than I am. Something large and enduring that has lasted through the ages. Through harsh weather, storms and droughts, through changes in history and climate, the ocean keeps on rolling and the mountains keep on standing tall. When I think of you and our love and how I feel about you, I feel the same way. My love for you doesn’t make me feel small though, it makes me feel powerful and new. I look at you and I know that I will love you forever, through storms and droughts, through all the changes that will undoubtedly come our way. I will love you forever. There’s no changing that.  </p>

		<h2>This is the letter for him</h2>
		<p>My wish is to let you know that not a single day or night but that your thoughts never cease to come to my heart. You are on my mind in every second of this life or for every single minute of my days. You alone I want and it is you that my heart has chosen. I love you sweetheart!</p>

		<p>I’m thinking about breakfast right now, but nothing seems good enough. I could get a fresh cup of coffee, and it wouldn’t warm me up like you do. I could make a pillow from pancakes, and they wouldn’t be as soft as your lips. I could get a crepe filled with whip cream, strawberries, and powdered sugar and it still wouldn’t be as sweet as you.</p>
